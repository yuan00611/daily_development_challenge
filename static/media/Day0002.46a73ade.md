## React styled-component
### 👉Mixin

Mixin is a module way to reuse the css code with parameters.(just like a class that can use repeatedly.) This concept comes from SASS. When we want to use styled-component in React, we can also have two ways to write css with mixins. 

1. First way

```js
// Mixin
const size = (w, h = w) => `
  width: ${w};
  height: ${h};
`;

//Component
const Block = styled.div`
    ${size({w: "50px", h: "50px" })};
`;
```

2. Second way (can use props)

```js
import styled, { css } from "styled-components";

//Mixin
const baseShadow = css`
  box-shadow: ${({ color }) => `0 10px 6px -6px ${color || "#777"}`};
`;

//Component
const Container = styled.div`
  text-align: center;
  padding: 2rem;
  font-size: 1rem;
  ${baseShadow}
`

//Using props
const App = () => (
  <Container color="purple">
   <h1>Using box shadow mixin! 🧙</h1>
  </Container>
);
```

### 👉Keyframe

When we want to use animation in the css, we need to use keyframe to help us set every detail in the timeline. In React, there are two ways can write keyframe object.

1. First way (styled-component recommended due to the name collision issue)

```js
const anim1 = keyframes`
    0% {
        bottom: 0px;
    }
    50% {
        bottom: 100px;
        background-color: red;
    }
    100% {
        bottom: 0px;
    }
`

const Block = styled.div`
	animation: ${anim1} 1s infinite;
`
```

2. Second way (normal css way)

```js
const Block = styled.div`
	animation: ${anim1} 1s infinite;
	
	@keyframes anim1 {
      100% {
        transform: rotate(360deg);
      }
    }
`
```

## Animation

Using CSS Animation can help the performance optimization.(It will be better than using Javascript.)

### 👉animation-timing-function

* Using `animation-timing-function` can define the speed curve of the animation

### 👉animation-play-state

* We can use `running` or `paused` to change the animation state.

### 👉transform-origin

* We can use `transform-origin` to set the origin with the transformed element.
* We can use keyword `top, bottom, left, right, center` or use (% or px)
* `transform-origin: x-offset y-offset z-offset(px only)`
